bluetooth-screen-lock (0.1.11-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Peter Nearing ]
  * Harden autostart delay wrapper to avoid PATH-dependent tools.
    Use absolute /bin/sh and /bin/sleep, resolve base64 with shutil.which
    and require an absolute path; gracefully fall back to no delay if
    base64 is unavailable. Eliminates PATH ambiguity at login.
  * DBus calls: set finite default timeouts (3000ms) in _dbus_call() and
    _dbus_call_reply() to prevent indefinite hangs if a DBus service stalls.
    Remove explicit -1 (infinite) call-site usages so new defaults apply.
