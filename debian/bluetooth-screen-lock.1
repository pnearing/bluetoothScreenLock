.B bluetooth-screen-lock
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bluetooth-screen-lock
is a small GNOME/GTK tray application that monitors the RSSI (signal strength)
of a configured Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device and locks the screen when the
device moves away and unlocks (or stays unlocked) when it is near.
.PP
It is implemented in Python using GTK and Bleak. The app is intended for GNOME
or other GTK-based desktop environments and provides a status icon (tray) with
a menu.
.SH OPTIONS
The interactive tray app does not take mandatory command-line options. It reads
its configuration from a YAML file located at:
.PP
\~\/.config\/bluetooth-screen-lock\/config.yaml

Key configurable fields include:
.IP \[bu] 2

near command in shell mode (advanced) to reduce ambiguity. Shell execution is
potentially unsafe and should only be enabled if you trust the command.
